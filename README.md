# websites-for-screensavers
 A (seldom updated) collection of URLs to display data-driven visualizations, cool WebGL, or just plain goofy sites.
 
 I've always loved screen savers, since my first Mac and the glory days of After Dark.
 
 They've long since outlived their original usefulness, but they can still be a chance to see/experience something only a desktop computer can render.
