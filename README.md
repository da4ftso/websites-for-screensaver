# Websites for Screensavers
 A (seldom updated) collection of URLs to display data-driven visualizations, cool WebGL, or just plain goofy sites.
 
 I've always loved screen savers, since my first Mac and the glory days of After Dark.  Newsmap.co.jp (RIP).  PlaneTracker.  Hint.fm/wind.  To name but a few.
 
 They've long since outlived their original usefulness, but they can still be a chance to see/experience something only a desktop computer can render.
 
 To see the computer's subconscious.
