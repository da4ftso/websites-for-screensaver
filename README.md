# Websites for Screensavers
 A (seldom updated) collection of URLs to display data-driven visualizations, cool WebGL, or just plain goofy sites.
 
 Inspired by https://github.com/agarrharr/awesome-macos-screensavers (among many others).
 
 I've always loved screen savers, since my first Mac and the glory days of After Dark.  Newsmap.co.jp (RIP).  PlaneTracker.  Hint.fm/wind.  To name but a few.
 
 They've long since outlived their original usefulness, but they can still be a chance to see/experience something only a desktop computer can render.
 
 To use some cycles and some bandwidth to visualize data, or give your GPU a workout, or (hopefully) make you crack a smile.

## .savers
 While there were plenty of free and paid options pre-macOS Monterey, on Ventura and Apple Silicon, I prefer https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver.
